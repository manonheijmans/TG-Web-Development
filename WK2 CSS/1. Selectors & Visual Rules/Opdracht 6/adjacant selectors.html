    <h1>Adjacent selectors</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
            Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following". The
            following
            example selects the first paragraph element that are placed immediately after div elements:</p>
        <div></div>
        <p>div + p {
            color: darkblue;
            }
        </p>
    </div>
