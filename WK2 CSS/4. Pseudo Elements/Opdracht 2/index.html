    <h1>Opdracht 2</h1>
    <b>Er zijn 14 verschillende pseudo elementen. Je hebt in de voorgaande opdracht reeds 4 kunnen benoemen. Kun je de
        andere 10 ook benoemen en aangeven wat ze precies doen?
    </b>
    <p>In CSS, ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element. It is often used to add
        cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.</p>
    <p>The ::backdrop CSS pseudo-element is a box the size of the viewport which is rendered immediately beneath any
        element being presented in full-screen mode. This includes both elements which have been placed in full-screen
        mode using the Fullscreen API and dialog elements. </p>
    <p>n CSS, ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element. It is often used to add
        cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.</p>
    <p>The ::cue CSS pseudo-element matches WebVTT cues within a selected element. This can be used to style captions
        and other cues in media with VTT tracks.</p>
    <p>The ::cue-region CSS pseudo-element matches WebVTT cues within a selected element. This can be used to style
        captions and other cues in media with VTT tracks.</p>
    <p>The ::first-letter CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first letter of the first line of a block-level
        element, but only when not preceded by other content (such as images or inline tables).</p>
    <p>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::first-line</p>
    <p>The ::file-selector-button CSS pseudo-element represents the button of an input of type="file".</p>
    <p>The ::grammar-error CSS pseudo-element represents a text segment which the user agent has flagged as
        grammatically incorrect.</p>
    <p>The ::marker CSS pseudo-element selects the marker box of a list item, which typically contains a bullet or
        number. It works on any element or pseudo-element set to display: list-item, such as the li and summary
        elements.</p>
    <p>The ::part CSS pseudo-element represents any element within a shadow tree that has a matching part attribute.</p>
    <p>The ::placeholder CSS pseudo-element represents the placeholder text in an input or textarea element.</p>
    <p>The ::selection CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the part of a document that has been highlighted by the user
        (such as clicking and dragging the mouse across text).</p>
    <p>The ::slotted() CSS pseudo-element represents any element that has been placed into a slot inside an HTML
        template (see Using templates and slots for more information). This only works when used inside CSS placed
        within a shadow DOM. Note also that this selector won't select a text node placed into a slot; it only targets
        actual elements.</p>
    <p>The ::spelling-error CSS pseudo-element represents a text segment which the user agent has flagged as incorrectly
        spelled.</p>
    <p>The ::target-text CSS pseudo-element represents the text that has been scrolled to if the browser supports
        scroll-to-text fragments. It allows authors to choose how to highlight that section of text.</p>
