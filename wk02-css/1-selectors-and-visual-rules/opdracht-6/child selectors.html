    <h1>Child selectors</h1>
    <p>The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element. The difference between
        child en descendant selector is as follows: Descendant means anywhere nested within it in the DOM tree. Could be
        a direct child, could be five levels deep, it is still a descendant. This is different than a child combinator
        (>) which requires the element to be the next nested level down.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <div>
        <p>
            div > p {
            color: green;
            }
        </p>
    </div>
